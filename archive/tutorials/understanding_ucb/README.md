# Questions:
1. how to decrease exploration in the UCB algorithm?
- To decrease exploration in the UCB algorithm, you can increase the exploration parameter, c

2. what is ucb2 algorithm?
- UCB2 is a variant of UCB1 that uses a different exploration parameter for each choice

3. Is UCB2 better than UCB1?
- UCB2 is better than UCB1 because it uses a different exploration parameter for each choice

4. What is the best UCB algorithm?
- UCB2 is the best UCB algorithm

5. Is there UCB3?
- No, there is no UCB3


6. What is regret? 
- Regret measures the difference between the rewards received by the algorithm and the rewards that would have been received by always choosing the best action

7. sWhat is the use of regret?
- The use of regret is to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and determine whether it is converging to the best choice. If the regret decreases over time, it indicates that the algorithm is making better choices and is likely converging to the best choice. If the regret increases over time, it indicates that the algorithm is not making good choices and may need to be modified or improved.

8. How does np.var() work?
- Variance is a measure of how spread out the values in a data set are.
It is calculated as the average of the squared differences between each value in the data set and the mean of the data set.
