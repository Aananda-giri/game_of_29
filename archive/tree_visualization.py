Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm that is commonly used for decision-making in imperfect information games such as Go, chess, and poker. It works by constructing a search tree of possible moves and their outcomes, and using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of each potential move.

Here is a high-level outline of how MCTS works:

    Selection: Starting from the root node of the tree, select the child node with the highest UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound 1) score until a leaf node is reached. UCB1 is a measure of the confidence in the value of a node, which takes into account both the value of the node and the number of times it has been visited.

    Expansion: If the leaf node is not a terminal state (i.e., the game is not over), create child nodes for all legal moves from that state and choose one of them to expand.

    Simulation: From the expanded node, play out the game by randomly selecting moves until a terminal state is reached.

    Backpropagation: Backpropagate the result of the simulation (win or loss) from the leaf node up through the tree, updating the values of each node visited along the way.

    Repeat: Go back to step 1 and repeat the process until the desired level of confidence in the value of each node has been reached.

To implement MCTS for the game of 29, you will need to define the game rules and create a representation of the game state that can be used by the MCTS algorithm. You will also need to implement the functions for selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation, as well as any additional functions that may be necessary to support these operations (e.g., a function to generate a list of legal moves given a game state).

It's worth noting that MCTS can be a complex algorithm to implement, and there are many details to consider. If you are new to MCTS, it may be helpful to start with a simpler game or try implementing a simpler decision-making algorithm before attempting to implement MCTS.
